# EE511_Fall2016
This is the repository for EE 511 @USC for Fall 2016 class. I will upload all the samples codes I use for office hours to this repository. Even though I will try to cover every language, that is to say-- R, Python and MATLAB, I will mainly use Python as an illustration.
## Environment
Here is a list of environment I use for all the example codes
### Matlab
* [Matlab] - The language of technical computing (R2016a)
### Python
* [Python] - A programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively (3.5.2)
* [scipy] - Fundamental library for scientific computing (0.18.0)
* [numpy] - Base N-dimensional array package (1.11.1)
* [matplotlib] - Comprehensive 2D Plotting (1.5.1)
### R
* [R] - A free software environment for statistical computing and graphics (3.3.1)
## Content
* [Basic Examples] - Some sample codes of those three languages, which give you a simple taste of the languages.
